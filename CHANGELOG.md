# Source change record

## CHG-20261021-06 — Approved public Client boundary

Requirement: R304 / DEC282 and the user's approved five-repository plan. Establish this repository as the sole maintained Client source line; keep internal history and operational tools private. Use the new regional distribution repository names without changing plugin IDs, service domains or synchronization source. Login and billing remain design-only. Add Windows/Linux unit, build, isolation and local community-lint checks.

License: Apache-2.0 for new Client candidates; existing releases through 0.1.81 and their MIT assets remain unchanged. No new version, production deployment or Global release is performed by this source publication. Local validation and official review are distinct.

## CHG-20261021-08 — Regional lint artifacts in clean CI

Requirement: R304 public standalone verification. The first public CI exposed a missing root dependency map: regional builds write their own artifact directories. Lint now selects the matching regional manifest and dependency map explicitly. Runtime source, lint rules and coverage are unchanged. Local checks on a reused checkout did not expose the missing-root-file condition; the initial CI failure is retained.
