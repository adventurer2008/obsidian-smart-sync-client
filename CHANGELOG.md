# Source change record

## Unreleased — CHG-20261021-14 — Community CSS compatibility

Requirement: U300/R310; DEC291. Address the two Community CSS warning categories in the next release. Replace the common-settings flex column gap with logical margins on action rows. Replace pairing-code important declarations with modal-scoped span and input selectors, preserving blue, large, bold digits. Published 0.1.82, its tag and artifacts remain unchanged; this source maintenance does not publish or deploy a version. Keep the existing in-plugin infinity logo. The Community icon picker currently offers built-in icons, without a custom image upload control; no substitute icon is selected.

## CHG-20261021-06 — Approved public Client boundary

Requirement: R304 / DEC282 and the user's approved five-repository plan. Establish this repository as the sole maintained Client source line; keep internal history and operational tools private. Use the new regional distribution repository names without changing plugin IDs, service domains or synchronization source. Login and billing remain design-only. Add Windows/Linux unit, build, isolation and local community-lint checks.

License: Apache-2.0 for new Client candidates; existing releases through 0.1.81 and their MIT assets remain unchanged. No new version, production deployment or Global release is performed by this source publication. Local validation and official review are distinct.

## CHG-20261021-08 — Regional lint artifacts in clean CI

Requirement: R304 public standalone verification. The first public CI exposed a missing root dependency map: regional builds write their own artifact directories. Lint now selects the matching regional manifest and dependency map explicitly. Runtime source, lint rules and coverage are unchanged. Local checks on a reused checkout did not expose the missing-root-file condition; the initial CI failure is retained.

## CHG-20261021-13 — China 0.1.82 production candidate

Requirement: U299/R309; DEC290. The user authorizes delivering all maintained, unpublished work through the complete paired release flow. Bump China Client to 0.1.82; retain existing runtime features, original modification times, plugin identity and approved-account login. Publish generated China source and matching artifacts together. Include Apache-2.0 and regional repository metadata introduced since 0.1.81; existing MIT releases remain unchanged. Global login, billing, complete English and overseas hosting remain unimplemented. Server stays 0.1.26 because its business source and schema are unchanged. Production, exact-pair CI, mail and Community release verification are separate acceptance gates and are not pre-recorded as passed.
